### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nastya Timofeeva, a budding web developer with a passion for becoming a full-stack developer. My skill set includes proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development, and I'm currently exploring the realms of React and Next.js for more dynamic and interactive web applications.

I'm currently working on honing my coding skills and expanding my knowledge in web development.

As a web developer in the making, I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to enhance my skill set.

In addition to my coding journey, I've been a graphic designer since 2016 (Photoshop CS6). I bring a creative touch to my projects, merging design and functionality.

You can find my personal blog [cyberkesa.ru](https://cyberkesa.ru/), which I've built from the ground up. Stay tuned for exciting updates as I transition away from CMS to create a more customized experience.
